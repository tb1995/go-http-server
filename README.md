My go journey finally begins! 

Inspired by this coding challenge:

This project is a basic HTTP server written in Go that serves HTML files located in the `www` directory. It's a beginner-friendly project aimed at learning the basics of building web servers in Go.

Default port is set to `:3333` in the `.env` file
